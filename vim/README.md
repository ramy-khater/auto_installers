# VIM Installer!

VIM Installer exists for two reasons:

1. For whom consider VIM is hard to install and use.
2. For me to make it easy to get up and running new machines :).

* [pathogen.vim]

## Support

This script WILL get stale. As mirrors die and versions increase, the download commands in this script may not work anymore. If this happens to you, please fork the script and fix it. Let's keep this working forever!
